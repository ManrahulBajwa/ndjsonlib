# ndjsonlib

## Introduction
The ndjson package provides an interface to read and write Dataset-JSON as NDJSON. It can convert to and from the JSON
format of Dataset-JSON. It also supports storing NDJSON metadata and data as separate files and combining them for 
data exchange. Maintaining the metadata in a separate file makes it simple to update the creationDatetime and the 
records attributes without requiring an application to re-write the entire file.
